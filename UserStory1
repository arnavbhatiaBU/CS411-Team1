As a user, I want to be able to see my existing National Day Playlists when I log into my account. 
When I click on a playlist, I would like to see the songs displayed in the playlist, with the album cover images, and the playlist cover image. 
I would also like to see what holiday each of the playlists correspond to. 
It would also be nice to be able to play the song on the website, but you would need a Spotify premium account to be able to play songs on demand.
