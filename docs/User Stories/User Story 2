As a user, I want to be able to view all of the National Days that are on the day that I log into the app. 
When I type in a date, I want to see a list of all of today’s national days, such as “national frog day” or “national apple day.”  
When I hover over the day, I want a playlist of songs that are related to today’s national day.
