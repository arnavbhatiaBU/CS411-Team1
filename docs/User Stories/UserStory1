As a user, I want to be able to easily search new days. 
After I look up one date in Spotidate, I do not want to have to log out in order to create a new search.
When I look up a date, I would like to see the songs displayed neatly for a suggested playlist.  
I would also like to easily see what holiday to which each of the playlists correspond.
