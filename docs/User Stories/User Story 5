As a user, I want to be able to ignore certain songs in the generated playlist that I did not enjoy. 
The application should remember my music and podcast taste and should filter out other songs and episodes based on the artists in the future. 
I do not want to listen to past related songs that I already showed distaste for in order to make room for newer music and episodes in the playlist.
