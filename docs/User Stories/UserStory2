As a user, I want to be able to view all of the National Days that are on the day of my choosing when I log into the app. 
When I type in a date, I want to see a list of all of that day’s national days, such as “national frog day” or “national apple day.”  
When I view the day, I want a playlist of songs that are related to today’s national day.
