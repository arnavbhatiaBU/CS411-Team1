As a user, I would like to be able to be given a playlist in a format that is easy and accessible enough 
to share with friends and family that do not have the app. 
This is possible by the playlists easily being accessible to copy and paste into email or text message.
My friends nor I need Spotify to view the playlist.
I can then create the playlist on any music app of my choosing.
