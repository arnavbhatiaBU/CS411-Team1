As the user, I would like to pick which songs off of the suggested playlist that I want to listen to.
If I do not like all of the song suggestions on the playlist, I do not want that plalist to be
automatically created in case I do not like the top 20 songs for my chosen holiday. 
I want to be able to view all of the songs and then pick which ones I want to put on my own playlist.
