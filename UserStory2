As a user, I want to be able to view all of the National Days that are on the day that I log into the app. 
When the app launches, I want to see a list of all of today’s national days, such as “national frog day” or “national apple day.” 
I then want to be able to select the national day that is of the most interest to me. 
When I pick that one, I want a playlist of songs that are related to today’s national day. 
I want to then be able to listen to that generated playlist on Spotify.
