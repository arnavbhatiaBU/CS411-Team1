PROJECT: NATIONAL DAYS SPOTIFY PLAYLIST

The app will have a bar at the top where the user can enter today's date. 
After entering the current date, a list of all of today's national holidays appear.
Examples of this include national ice cream day, national frog day, international women's day, Christmas, etc. 
From here, the user can click on the national holiday that is of the most interest to them.
Clicking on the national holiday will then generate a playlist in Spotify for that chosen day. 
For example, if today is national basketball day, clicking on that button will generate a Spotify playlist about basketball. 
We will be using Python for both the front and back end.
We will be using Flask and React. 
The public APIs we will be using is a national days calendar API and the Spotify API. 
For third party authentication, we will use OAuth through a google profile.
We will use a decoupled architecture in which the front and back ends will communicate via a RESTful interface.
